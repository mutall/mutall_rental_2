//This class supports management of the opening balances. 
//
//There are 2 types of opening balances. Those:-
//(a) that are initially provided externally (as some special type of adjutment)
//(b) calculated and posted from a previous.
//The opening balance discrepancy is noted if (a) and (b) are both available and
//different from each other for any client.
//After the closing balance derived from (a) is posted, then all opening balances
//below the cutoff should be flagged as posted
//
//The following items support opening balances.
//- auto_balance(client*, period*, amount)
//- manual_balance(clent*, period*, amount, posted)
//
//Auto balances is an item driven by the closing balances. Ths process of posting
//autobalances does not create them. they are created by the closing balance item
//
//Manual balances are fed directly by the user; their dates are adjusted so that
//their dates are consisten with opeing balance. So an entry dated 31/1/2018 is
//re-dated as the opening balance of 1/2/2018
//
//eted with are Note the following:-
//The fields marked * are needed for identification
//
//The post field in teh closing balances table is used for marking when an auto
//balance is posted, because the link to invoice is not sufficient for the job
//
//Opening balance is neither a unary, nor a binary item; it s both! This is 
//because it is driven b
//manual or a auto-genertd item; it is both
