//This class supports management of chargeable, monthly services that are not 
//covered by rental, water or electricity charges. Identifying and delivering 
//these services should be a core business of a rental system to promote client
//satisfaction. The current services for Mutall include:-
//
//. security
//. gabbage collection.
//
//The following servics are in the planning stages:-
// 
//. IT consultations
//. Stand-by power supply
//
//The model to support these and future services comprises of the following 
//entities:-
//. service(name*, price, auto)
//. subscription(service*, client*, factor)
//. charge(servive*, period*, amount) 
//
//Notes:-
//(i) The cost of a service is calculated in 2 ways:- 
//
//a) charge = subscription.factor * service_type.price or
//b) charge = service_type.price
//
//depending on whether the servce is automatic or not.
//Formula a) is suplied if the service is subscribed. This method is used to levy
//non-standard charges to selected clients
//Formula be is used if a service is automatic and ahas not been subscribed.
//subscriibed.
//If a service is not automatic and has not been subscribed, e.g., water charges
//then other criteria must be used for calculating the charge. That becomes a new
//item that is driven by client, usses charge as the storage and uses water meter
//connection to pick out shich clents to charge.
//
//The subscription factor is estimated by a joint assessment when a client is
//registered, but can be altered during rent life when the service usage is 
//better estimated. This fact is used to adjust charges on after the 3rd year of 
//client occupancy
//
//Service is a binay item because it is pposting it involves 2 tables: the client
//as the driver and the charge as the storage for the posted erecords.
