/*
This class manages electricity charges, to Mutall clients, computed from 
Kenya Power bills, or estimated from our own local readings. The last option is
not implemented yet. For KPLC billing, the following figure represents possible 
billing scenarios, where:-
ui = the i'th unposted billing date
pj = the j'th posted billing date
c = the cutoff date, i.e., the last day of the current invoice period.

Figure 1: Bill posting  scenarions
 
-----v---v---v----------v---------------v---------v----------v-------p--
     u1  p1  u2         p2              u3        c          u4      p3

Question: what is the bill to charge the client for period c, u1..u4?
 
Intuitively, it is u3, where:- 
1. the bill is unposted, so it cannot be any of the pi's
2. the billing date is:-
    a. below or equal to to the cutoff, so u4 is out, leaving [u1, u2, u3]
    b. the highest below the cutoff date
    c. higher than p2 where p2 is a posted bill with the highest date below
       the cutoff -- if p2 exists.
Bill u3 may be divided between a number of clients, depending on whether it is 
shared or not, to arrive at a, the amount to be charged. The charge is 0 if 
there is not sharing, as these clients pay directly to Kenya power

To simplify the logic for selecting teh appropriate bill to charge at any time,
we assume that if a bill is bosted, the all the raelier unposted ones will 
be marhes as posted. This means that in figure 1, bills u1 and u2 would all have
been flagged as posted because they are earlier than p2
